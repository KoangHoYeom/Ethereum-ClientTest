# Ethereum JSON-RPC, Did not use the web3j when communicate smart contract

I think web3j is a good project. However, this library is difficult for beginners to use.
So I have developed a project that makes the web3j project a little easier to access. 
If you use this project before using web3j, you can use web3j more easily.
